    "1. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (called a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (called a superclass or base class). Inheritance enables the subclass to inherit the attributes and behaviors (i.e., fields and methods) of the superclass. This means that the subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, promoting code reuse and organization. \n",
    "                                                                                  Here's why inheritance is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to reuse the code that is already defined in the superclass. Instead of rewriting the same code in multiple places, you can create subclasses that inherit the common functionality from a shared superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Polymorphism: Inheritance is a key element in achieving polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This facilitates the use of generic code that can work with a variety of objects."

    "Single Inheritance : In single inheritance, a subclass (derived class) can inherit from only one superclass (base class). This means that a class can have only one immediate parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages :\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Simplicity: Single inheritance is conceptually simpler because each class has a clear and direct parent class, making the class hierarchy easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance : In multiple inheritance, a subclass can inherit from more than one superclass. This means that a class can have multiple immediate parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages :\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Reusability: Multiple inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing a class to inherit and reuse features from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "-> Versatility: It allows you to model complex relationships and combine functionalities from different sources.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between single and multiple inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",

    "-> Number of Superclasses: The primary difference is the number of superclasses a subclass can inherit from. Single inheritance allows only one superclass, while multiple inheritance allows multiple superclasses.\n",
