It allows methods to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and other methods. When you call an instance method, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument (conventionally named self) to the method. This allows the method to interact with the specific instance's data and behavior. Without self, methods wouldn't have a way to differentiate between different instances of the same class."
